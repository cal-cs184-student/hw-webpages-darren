		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Polygone is an interactive mesh repair and remeshing toolkit designed to clean up, optimize, and transform 3D triangle meshes. Built atop the half-edge mesh structure provided in homework 2, Polygone supports several robust mesh operations that collectively improve mesh regularity and enable stlyistic transformations. Key features of Polygone include vertex shifting, edge collapsing, degenerate triangle removal, missing face filling, and custom remeshing algorithms such as voxel-based pixelation. We also developed export functionality to allow the output of processed meshes in standard .obj format for compatability with external tools like Minecraft. Throughout the project, we emphasized interactivity and usability by incorporating a GUI with buttons and multi-element selection, extending the basic hotkey-based interface of our starting framework. Our result is a flexible mesh editing tool tailored for both geometric correction and creative remeshing!

		<h2>Baseline and New Features</h2>
		Our project began with a skeleton mesh viewer from homework 2, which provided a half-edge mesh representation. Our goal was to expand this into a full-featured mesh cleanup and transformation tool that could:
		<br> 1. Improve mesh quality through resampling and smoothing,
		<br> 2. Repair structural issues like missing faces and degenerate triangles,
		<br> 3. Enable stylized remeshing through voxelization
		<br> 4. Export meshes to commonly used formats like .obj

		<h2>Technical Approach</h2>
		<h3>Tools for Remeshing</h3>
		First, we began by implementing edge collapse. This function is similar to the existing edge flip and edge split functions, but the exact details of the operation follow the diagrams that can be seen below.
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

				<td style="text-align: center;">
					<img src="./images/edgeCollapseAfter.jpg" width="400px"/>
					<figcaption>Mesh After Edge Collapse</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>

		</div>
        <br><br>Vertex shifting is also an important operation in surface remeshing that helps improve mesh quality by moving vertices towards their optimal positions based on their neighboring vertices to create more uniform, isotropic faces. While edge splits and collapses adjust mesh regularity by creating and destroying faces, vertex shift maintains all the current faces but repositions them. For our implementation, we apply vertex shift by repositioning each non-boundary vertex to the centroid of its direct neighbors. This shifting step helps smooth meshes by improving triangle uniformity and reducing skewness of the mesh while not deviating too significantly from the input geometry.
		<br><br>Explicitly, the formula we used for calculating the correction vector of a vertex v was corr = (v_1 + v_2 + … + v_n)/n - v, where v_1, v_2, …, v_n represent the direct neighboring vertices of v. This correction vector is scaled by a factor lambda between 0 and 1 to control how greatly each vertex should move towards its new position. 
		<br><br>In our implementation, we also allow for the pinning of vertices to keep them fixed in place throughout iterations of vertex shift. Similar to the edge modification functions, multiple vertices can be selected using shift + left click, and these vertices will remain fixed in place. This feature is useful for preserving sharp geometries in a mesh that might be softened over many iterations of vertex shift. 

		<h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
        We plan to figure out the best methods and algorithms to regularize and simplify meshes. Specifically, we will be implementing isotropic remeshing with Voronoi diagrams and quadric error mesh simplification. Using these algorithms, we want to investigate if we can regularize and simplify the geometry of meshes while still preserving the same structure.
        We will present before and after examples of the remeshing techniques we implement to demonstrate their effectiveness. For both regularization and simplification, we will evaluate our success based on visual results. For regularization, we aim for each polygon in our mesh to be the same size, while for simplication, we want the general shape of the mesh to remain the same. To emphasize the effects of our algorithms, we will construct meshes containing polygons of largely varying sizes as overly complicated meshes.

		<h2>Things We Learned</h2>
		<h3>Chris</h3>
		While working on this project, I learned that putting effort into something that might not end up working is a key part of the development process. Especially given how open-ended and exploratory this project is, it's bound to happen that some of our initial ideas and goals don't pan out perfectly. However, what’s more important is that we don’t get discouraged and maintain the flexibility to find solutions in other places.

		<h3>Darren</h3>
		I gained experience working on larger codebases in C++ through this project. The features I worked on in particular required looking at and modifying code that wasn't originally looked at in homework 2, and I spent a fair amount of time reading through documentation to properly understand how things work in C++ and in the homework 2 codebase. Similar to Chris, one of my major takeaways was also how to adapt when preferred solutions don't work out. I initially intended to use NanoGUI for our interface, but the significant compatability and linking issues forced me to pivot and design an alternative system. 
		<h3>Michael</h3>
		During this project, I got very comfortable working with halfedge meshes as well as traversing and modifying the structure using halfedges. More importantly, I learned how easy it is to accidentally create invalid iterators while modifying a mesh, leading to segfaults. I also learned about some pretty interesting algorithms in the creation of the pixellate remesh operation.

		<h3>Walter</h3>
		I learned several things in this project:
		<br> 1. Always debug on a simple and tiny mesh. A huge and complex mesh could burn my brain out.
		<br> 2. Delete everything that disappears. When I remove a face, vertex, or edge, also delete (or mark) its half‑edges and clear any pointers to it. One dangling face* in a half‑edge will crash the next traversal.
		<br> 3. Choose L relative to the model. Too small and I will split forever, too large and I will collapse everything.
		<br> 4. Always early‑out on e->isBoundary() (or handle a special boundary collapse/split) before touching twin()->face() or walking a vertex ring. This will avoid a lot of terrible segmentation faults.
		<br> 5. The most valuable thing I learned is how to debug a large project. I practiced how to use a debugger instead of a print statement, and how to handle segmentation faults.

		<h2>Contributions</h2>
		<h3>Chris</h3>
		My main roles in this project were to guide the direction of Polygone and implement the mesh exporting functionality. While working on the project, I streamlined Polygone’s focus while examining the strengths of our medium and pre-established code. I also made the outline for our report and edited the final video. Apart from that, I also spent extensive time debugging various things throughout the project’s lifespan.
		<h3>Darren</h3>
		I worked on implementing vertex shift and the pinning involved for vertex shift. I also created functionality to enable the selection of multiple elements for edge flipping, splitting, and collapsing. I also developed the GUI for our project to allow for interactive buttons for our remeshing instead of solely hotkeys like in Homework 2 and helped to debug other features like collapse edge.
		<h3>Michael</h3>
		I implemented edge collapse, fix missing faces, fix degenerate faces, and pixelate remesh operation. I also added the ability to change the voxel size of a pixelated mesh dynamically so that we can easily experiment with different sizes of voxel. In addition, I spent a lot of time debugging various features of the project, especially segfaults caused by collapsing edges.
		<h3>Walter</h3>
		I built and debugged the incremental remeshing function: designing iterator‑safe loops and implementing nearest‑surface projection, combining the four stages together, and hot‑key controls—so the system now transforms ragged input into a uniformly mesh without drift or topological artifacts.
